    Procedure call and return occurs quite often in high-level programming languages.
    translated into machine language, a procedure call produces a sequence of instructions that 
    save register values, pass parameters needed for the procedure, and then calls a subroutine to 
    execute the body of the procedure. After a procedure return, the program restores the old 
    register values, passes results to the calling program, and returns from the subroutine. Saving 
    and restoring registers and passing of parameters and results involve time consuming 
    operations.<hr>
    <h2>The main reson</h2>
    A characteristic of some RISC processors is their use of overlapped register 
    windows to provide the passing of parameters and avoid the need for saving and restoring 
    register values. <br>
    Berkeley RISC I
     One of the first projects intended to show the advantages of RISC architecture was
    conducted at the University of California, Berkeley.
     The Berkeley RISC I is a 32-bit integrated circuit CPU.  <br><hr> It supports 32-bit addresses and
    either 8-, 16-, or 32-bit data.<br><hr>It has a 32-bit instruction format and a total of 31 instructions.
     There are three basic addressing modes: register addressing, immediate operand, and
    relative to PC addressing for branch instructions. It has a register file of 138 registers arranged
    into 10 global registers and 8 windows of 32 registers in each <hr>
